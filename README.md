### Reflections and Comments
* How did this go, overall? It went well for the most part. One small issue that still needs to be taken care of.
* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far? Placement is key. One small move and everything gets displaced.
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? The full three hours of the lab, plus whatever it takes to fix the last issue .And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment? The length of the lab.
